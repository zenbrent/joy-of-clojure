;; These are used to define identity, and determines change semantics:

;;;; Refs
;; Coordinated - multiple refs can be changed without race conditions.
;; Retriable -- changes are speculative and may have to be retried.
;;;; Agents
;; Async
;;;; Atoms
;; Retriable
;;;; Vars
;; Thread-local

;; All but vars are  considered shared references and allow changes to be seen
;; across threads of execution. Even though their use cases overlap, each
;; has an ideal use.

;; Concurrency is running multiple things at once
;; parallelism is partitioning work until multiple pieces that can run concurrently, typically towards building an aggregate.

;; "A faster program that doesnâ€™t work right is useless." -- Peyton-Jones in Beautiful Concurrency

;; Time, state, identity:
;; relative moments that events occur
;; a snapshot of an entity at a moment in time
;; the logical entity identified by a common stream of states occuring over time.

;; Transaction is demarked by (dosync ...)
;; Changes in a dosync all succeed or fail together.

;; Deref all types with # or (deref ...)
;; They all mutate with different functions, but those all have the same structure.

;; Embedded transaction: clojure absorbs nested transactions into the parent,
;; so if one fails, they're all retried.

;; STM provides:
;; ACI -- atomicity, consistency, isolation, w/o manual locking.
;; in memory, so durability isn't relevant.
;; But:
;; Write skew -- in mvcc (multiversion concurrency control) happens when on transaction
;; uses a reference value to control it's behavoir, but doesn't write to it, and another
;; transaction writes to that value. Clojure can prevent this with `ensure`.
;; Live lock -- a set of transaction(s) that repeatedly restart each other. Clojure does
;; fight this.

;; In a transaction, don't:
;; IO -- because retries. Use io! macro when doing io to ensure it isn't used in a transaction.
;; e.g. (io! (.println System/out "sups yo!"))
;; (dosync (io! (.println System/out "sups yo!"))) ;; throws error
;; Mutate things -- b/c it's usu. not idempotent.
;; Large transactions -- do as little work as possible in them.


;; Snapshot isolation: in a transaction, all ref values used will be from the same moment in time.
;; Algorithms should be designed so they only care that values haven't changed before a commit.
;; (unless it's commutative)
;; Use (ensure ref) when referencing a value that isn't written to, which gurantees that a read-only
;; ref isn't written to in a transaction.
